      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this blog, I want to build attention from scratch. But I don&amp;rsquo;t want to jump straight into the best implementation. We&amp;rsquo;re going to start with dumbest, most naive possible code, see why it fails, and then add one idea at a time until attention falls on your head like the apple fell on Newton&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned it this way and it really stuck to me. This is heavily inspired from Karpathy&amp;rsquo;s video, and this concept has probably been beaten to hell. But the point of this blog is to just practice formalizing my notes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My First Post</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-this-site-for&#34;&gt;What is this site for?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will just be an online notebook where I will jot down my learnings. It is mainly for me to formalize my own thoughts. If I think my notes are quality enough, then I will post them here. This serves to help me rather than spread new knowledge, but who knows, maybe one day I&amp;rsquo;ll share something groundbreaking here &lt;code&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-will-i-post-here&#34;&gt;What will I post here?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will start off with putting my notes down about attention, the transformer, and GPT-2. Then I will add a post about the Llama-2 model. I hope to also make clean notes for the class I am taking right now, &lt;em&gt;18789: Deep Generative Modeling&lt;/em&gt;. I feel the professors teach very intutively, and if I were to scribe down lectures, I would learn a lot more than just sitting in class and paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
