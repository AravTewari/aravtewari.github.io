## What is this site for?
This will just be an online notebook where I will jot down my learnings. It is mainly for me to formalize my own thoughts. If I think my notes are quality enough, then I will post them here. This serves to help me rather than spread new knowledge, but who knows, maybe one day I'll share something groundbreaking here `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`. 

## What will I post here?
I will start off with putting my notes down about attention, the transformer, and GPT-2. Then I will add a post about the Llama-2 model. I hope to also make clean notes for the class I am taking right now, *18789: Deep Generative Modeling*. I feel the professors teach very intutively, and if I were to scribe down lectures, I would learn a lot more than just sitting in class and paying attention.

But other than that, we'll see where my studies take me!
